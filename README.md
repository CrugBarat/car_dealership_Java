# Car Dealership

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

## Brief

Model a car dealership, making sure to use the concepts that we’ve covered in Java so far as appropriate.

You should be working in a TDD fashion and creating tests for your classes. Make sure you plan effectively in preparation for the extensions if you have enough time to attempt them.

**MVP**

- Create classes for different components that can be used to compose a vehicle
- Create different vehicle types
- Assign them various properties
- Create classes for Customer and Dealership
- Customers will have money and a collection of owned vehicles
- Dealership will have stock of different types of cars and a till

**Extension**

- Allow a customer to buy a vehicle
- Allow dealership to buy vehicles
- Allow Dealerships to sell vehicles to customers
- Allow damage to be added to a vehicle
- This should be a cost and be removed from vehicles price
- Allow dealership to repair vehicles
- This should take the cost from the dealer and add back to value of vehicle
